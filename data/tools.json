    "details": "A Silent Crypto Miner Builder is a tool used to create cryptocurrency mining malware that operates covertly on infected systems. This type of malware, known as a crypto miner or cryptocurrency miner, uses the computational resources of the victim's computer to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, or Ethereum. The term 'silent' indicates that the miner runs in the background without the user's knowledge or consent, consuming CPU and GPU resources and potentially slowing down the system. <br/> These builders are typically used by cybercriminals to generate revenue by exploiting the computing power of multiple infected machines. They may spread through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or compromised websites. Users may notice symptoms such as increased CPU usage, reduced system performance, or overheating of hardware components.",
